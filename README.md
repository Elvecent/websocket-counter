# Websocket counter example
This example illustrates a way to keep and modify server-side state accesible through a websocket client, with query logging.

The code features the use of monad transformers and lenses.

To run the example, build or just run it with Stack and open `html/index.html` in a web-browser.

`$ stack repl`

*ghci starts up*

`*Main AppState Cmd Host> main`

*starts server and prints logs*
