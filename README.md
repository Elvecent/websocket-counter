# Websocket counter example
This code example illustrates a way to keep and modify server-side state accesible through a websocket client, with query logging.

To run the example, build or just run it with Stack and open `html/index.html` in a web-browser.
`$ stack repl`
*ghci starts up*
`*Main AppState Cmd Host> main`
*starts server and prints logs*
